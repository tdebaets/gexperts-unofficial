The GExperts source code is provided under an Open Source license to
encourage other users to contribute fixes and features.  Eventually,
there will be some documentation to help orient new readers to the
GExperts source code, but until then, this is all you have.  Here
are the steps to compile GExperts from the source code:

- Uncompress this Zip archive with directories (pkunzip GXSource.* -d,
  or use WinZip to extract the file).  Note that the archive contains
  long file names, so your unarchiver must support this.

- Open:
      GExpert5_bcb.bpr    Borland C++Builder 5.01
      GExpert5.dpr        Borland Delphi 5.01
      GExpert4_bcb.bpr    Borland C++Builder 4.01
      GExpert4.dpr        Borland Delphi 4.03
      GExpert3_bcb.bpr    Borland C++Builder 3.01
      GExpert3.dpr        Borland Delphi 3.02

  Prior versions of Delphi and C++Builder are not supported.

- Add the following items to your Delphi/C++Builder library path
  under the Environment Options:
  - <install path>\src
  - <install path>\Comps
  - <install path>\EII\D[345]

- In C++Builder 3.0 add the following items in Project | Options
  -> Directories/Conditionals BOTH to the "Include path" and the
  "Library path":

    eii\d3;comps;classbrowser;editorexperts;favfiles

  In C++Builder 4.0 add the following items, instead:

    eii\d4;comps;classbrowser;editorexperts;favfiles

  In C++Builder 5.01 add the following items, instead:

    eii\d5;comps;classbrowser;editorexperts;favfiles

- Open Project | Options
  - On the Packages page, check the "Build with runtime packages"
    item
  - Add these packages to the project's runtime package list
    (required to access various IDE internal units such as LibIntf):
     Vcl50;Vclx50;Vcldb50;VclBde50;DsnIde50  Borland C++Builder 5.01
     Vcl50;Vclx50;Vcldb50;VclBde50;DsnIde50  Borland Delphi 5.01
     Vcl40;Vclx40;Vcldb40                    Borland C++Builder 4.01
     Vcl40;Vclx40;Vcldb40                    Borland Delphi 4.03
     Vcl35;Vclx35;Vcldb35                    Borland C++Builder 3.01
     Vcl30;Vclx30;Vcldb30                    Borland Delphi 3.02
  - On the Linker page, enter a value of $06000000 (Delphi) or
    0x06000000 (C++Builder) for the Image Base
    (this should allow for efficient loading of the GExperts DLL)
  - In C++Builder, verify on the the Linker page that "Use Dynamic RTL"
    is checked.

- If you want to compile GExperts with any of VCLZip, TSyntaxMemo,
  mwEdit, or ACE Reporter, then edit GXSource\src\GX_CondDefine.inc
  as described there.  Some of the experts require these components.
  You may have to adapt the global library path, as well as the
  project specific Include and Library path (C++Builder only)
  for successful compilation.

- If you do not want to see Debug Window debugging messages, turn off
  compiler debug information under Project Options. If you use
  C++Builder, make sure that you modify the setting on the Pascal
  page, too.

- Build the project.  If you run into build problems with C++Builder,
  please have a look at the file BCBNotes.txt which contains further
  hints on building and using GExperts under C++Builder.

- Install the resulting DLL into the IDE using the registry editor
  "Regedit.exe" as described in the included Readme.txt file
  (remove older versions of GExperts first)

- To build the GExperts Debug Window, compile \DebugWin\GDebug.dpr.
  Do the same for ExpMgr.dpr and Grep.dpr if you would like to
  have stand-alone versions of these experts.

  Please note that there are currently no project files for use
  with C++Builder to build these projects there.

NOTE: If you want to open or edit some of the forms with non-standard
components you will have to install the components from the
GXSource/comps directory into a design-time package (the FileView,
FastSortTreeView, and SortGrid units contain custom components).
You may use the GExperts packages GXComponents?.DPK and
GXComponents?_BCB.BPK to help you install some of these components.

NOTE: If, while opening forms at runtime or designtime, you get
errors stating things like "Property XXX does not exist", you need to
open all of the relevant GExperts forms in your IDE before compiling.
When you get the same errors at designtime, ignore them, re-save
the form, and then compile again.  Before opening some of the forms,
you'll have to install the components contained on them, as described
above.  This nuisance is caused by the fact that a subsequent version
of the IDE you are using did not supply a default value for a newly
added property, making the form incompatible with older IDE versions.

Localization:

If you wish to localize the GExperts source code for different
international environments, refer to the IDE dodumentation under

 Programming with Delphi: Creating international applications
 Programming with C++Builder: Creating international applications

as well as the relevant Borland.com newsgroups at
nntp://forums.borland.com/ and their archive at http://www.deja.com/.

Specific to the localization of GExperts are the following items:

- Load the GExperts project into your IDE

- Make sure that your project has been built with a detailed MAP file
  (Project | Options --> Linker page)

- Choose File | New.  In the dialog, select the item: Resource DLL Wizard

  Note: some versions of Delphi and C++Builder do not ship with this wizard

- Follow the steps in the wizard

- Translate all items of the localization project

Repeat these steps with each source code release of GExperts.
